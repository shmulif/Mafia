Before working on this it is important to be familiar with the rules of Mafia. You can check out this Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)

Description:
The app is designed so that everyone can join from their own phone. The
software assigns random roles to everyone (At the moment it is designed for six players). The app gives abilities or
information to the players depending on their role. For example, the mafias
have the ability to eliminate someone and the detective is given someone's
identity. The game will run through night and day cycles. During the night the
mafia will communicate with a private chat between them and everyone with
abilities will be given the opportunity to use them. In the day there will be a chat
with all players, The mafia cannot communicate privately during the day. If
someone was eliminated they cannot participate in the chat. The game will
track who wins based on the rules of Mafia.
