**Mafia game for iOS**

Before working on this it is important to be familiar with the rules of Mafia. You can check out this Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)


**Description:**

The app is designed so that everyone can join from their own phone. The software assigns random roles to everyone (At the moment it is designed for six players). The app gives abilities or information to the players depending on their role. For example, the mafias have the ability to eliminate someone and the detective is given someone's
identity. The game will run through night and day cycles. During the night the mafia will communicate with a private chat between them and everyone with abilities will be given the opportunity to use them. In the day there will be a chat with all players, The mafia cannot communicate privately during the day. If someone was eliminated they cannot participate in the chat. The game tracks who wins based on the rules of Mafia.


**Setup Instructions:**

Like all iOS development, it must be done on a Mac.
1) Open Xcode (If you don't have it yet, download it from the Mac app store).
2) Select "Clone Git Repository" from the options that come up.
4) Paste the URL for this repository into the search bar that appears at the top.
5) Hit the "clone" button. 
3) After you select a location to save it, the file will open.

That's it, You're ready to start editing!

**Incorporating Firebase:**
You will need to set up a Firebase account and incorporate it into your project, This video provides a detailed guide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHWX5j6wUjA

**Some Ideas for Additions:**
1) Have the app work for a custom amount of players (Suggested minimum is four, one Mafifa, one Detective, one Doctor, one Civilian).
2) Have specialty roles that players can choose to include. There are some great ideas in the Wikipedia article above, as well as at this link https://deusexmafia.fandom.com/wiki/Mafia_Roles
3) Add an overview of the rules.
4) Create variations of the game that fit in different genres or time-periods. For example, there can be a werewolf variation or a world war II spy variation.

If you have a suggested addition I would love to hear it.
